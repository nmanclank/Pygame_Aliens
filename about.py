ALIENS! was a simple way to dip my toes in pygame. Originally intended to loosely follow one of the many of the
 available instructions for a space-invader like games."""

a2 = """ To be honest.. I havent fully commited. The general idea is that the 'player' will control a 'player' object
 that 'shoots' something. The player controlled object will be located at the bottom of the screen. Your
  main goal is to take out the 'alien' fleet using the left and right controls. The player has three lives (Maybe idk) and 
   you need to take out the fleet, but will another fleet take it's place? fuck idk maybe. or maybe not. Maybe the game will
  decide. Hell, for all I know you roll a 1 and the game uses exit(). Highscore? who knows. if you're lucky maybe. wait.. hey!
   get back here! Where are you going with the coffee machine? ....    ......
